            At World Samma Academy Shop, we stand by the quality of our gear. If
            you're not completely satisfied with your purchase, we're here to
            help. Think of our return policy as a friendly sparring
            partner—fair, straightforward, and designed to find the best
            outcome.

            30-Day Return Policy
          </h2>
          <p>
            We have a <strong>30-day return policy</strong>, which means you
            have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition
            that you received it: unworn or unused, with tags, and in its
            original packaging. You'll also need the receipt or proof of
            purchase.
          </p>

            How to Start a Return
          </h2>
          <p>
            To start a return, you can contact us at{" "}
            <a href="mailto:shop@worldsamma.org">shop@worldsamma.org</a>. If
            your return is accepted, we’ll send you instructions on how and
            where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first
            requesting a return will not be accepted.
          </p>

            Damages and Issues
          </h2>
          <p>
            Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately
            if the item is defective, damaged, or if you receive the wrong item,
            so that we can evaluate the issue and make it right. Just like in
            training, we learn from our mistakes and strive to improve.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Exchanges</h2>
          <p>
            The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the
            item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate
            purchase for the new item. This ensures you get your new gear as
            quickly as possible.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Refunds</h2>
          <p>
            We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return,
            and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved,
            you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method.
            Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card
            company to process and post the refund too.
